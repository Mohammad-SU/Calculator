# Calculator-CSharp
A relatively simple calculator with a similar display to the Windows calculator.

The main code I wrote:
https://github.com/Mohammad-SU/Calculator-CSharp/blob/main/Calculator/Calculator/CalcForm.cs

Things that may be added in the future include:
- More functions/operations
- Brackets
- A better order of operations
- A Display of the full expression on the top left of the calculator's display
