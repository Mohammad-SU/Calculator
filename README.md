Program in action: https://youtu.be/odKDBLcFtEo

A relatively simple calculator with a similar display to the Windows calculator. Created using the Visual Studio Windows Forms Template.

The main code I wrote:
https://github.com/Mohammad-SU/Calculator-CSharp/blob/main/Calculator/Calculator/CalcForm.cs

Future update ideas:
- More functions/operations
- Brackets
- A better order of operations
- A display of the complete expression on the top left of the calculator's display
