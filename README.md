A relatively simple calculator with a similar display to the Windows calculator - created using the Visual Studio Windows Forms template.

For some of the main code that I wrote:
https://github.com/Mohammad-SU/Calculator-CSharp/blob/main/Calculator/Calculator/CalcForm.cs

Future update ideas:
- More functions/operations
- Brackets
- A better order of operations
- A display of the complete expression on the top left of the calculator's display
